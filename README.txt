COMP30023 2023 Project 1

Code Style:
    Snake Case:
        Variable names, array names, function names, type names
    Camel Case: 
        Pointers (I think pPointer looks better than p_pointer).
        The exception to this is linked lists because they're
        more like a separate data type than an actual pointer 
        (It's not like list_xyz is referencing a variable that
        holds the a linked list).
    Captials:
        ENUMERATIONS, CONSTANTS, MACROS
